# Constraints
Some boundaries around our project.

## External
- constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over. These may include:

- simple color scheme, primarily black and white
HTML CSS JS

## Internal: Involuntary
- I will provide an honest representation of my current skill levels in HTML, CSS and JS

## Internal: Voluntary
- I will maintain a consistent coding style and follow good programming practices for clean and readable code.
- I commit to spending dedicated time on my poroject to ensure steady progress.
- My project will use a simple color scheme, primarily black and white, to achieve a clean and minimalist design.
